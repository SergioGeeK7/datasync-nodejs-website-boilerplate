## Contentstack Sync Utility Express Boilerplate

The Contentstack Sync is a remarkable utility for syncing your content and assets. This utility allows you to save your app data on a deviceâ€™s local storage and then fetch incremental changes through timely sync operations. After its first syncs data, the system delivers only the content that was changed since the last sync.

The SDK boilerplate allows you to create a website from the data that you synced through this utility. We have created step-by-step documentation to help you create a web page from the synced data. Based on the steps provided, you can create different pages for your website by following similar steps.
